I am David a software developer professional from Belfast, Northern Ireland currently working in the health sector as part of local goverment, but I like to tinker in all things moderen.

I manly working on my long term project Cella, is a warehouse managment system built uppon knowledge I have learnt over 20 years of software development exp.

Using systems such as sage and Business One had many short cummings for companies of my past employers and often felt I could do a better job in developing an all in one solution the main system is built in asp.net 5 moving to 6 once out of stable preview.

I plan to make the project open source so that can be contributed from the out side.

I love codding and just love to create things.

One thing am crap at is graphics so if anyone wants to help in that department that would be great.
